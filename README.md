# Universal KiCAD PCB template for ATMEGA 644/1284

## Key features of the project

### Versatile
Two types of packages (DIP-40 and TQFP-44) on one board.

### Reset control
Keep one microcontroller in reset state to use the other.

### Easy upgradeability
Unique hardware upgradeability of your device thanks to the DIP package

### Open Source
The project is distributed under the MIT license

### Optimized design
Designed for dual-layer PCBs with adaptability

## Our solution is particularly useful for:

- Developers working with prototypes
- Educational projects
- Small batch production
- Experimental development

### Technical realization

The board is designed to maximize port compatibility between both types of packages. Switching between microcontrollers is done via RESET line control, which ensures reliable operation of the system.

### Availability

All project materials, including schematics and PCB files, are available on GitHub.
We welcome community participation in the development of the project and look forward to your suggestions for improvement.
